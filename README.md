# Sequence Alignment

This is a small project that computes the dynamic programming matrices for any two sequences and a score function using these algorithms:
1. Needleman-Wunsch
2. Smith-Waterman
3. Overlap-Alignment

In addition, it computes the traceback for these matrices and present the optimal alignment.
<br>That project handled as an homework assignment for the course: "Algorithms in Computational Biology".
