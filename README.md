# Sequence Alignment

This is a small project that computes the dynamic programming matrices for any two sequences and a score function using these algorithms:
- Needleman-Wunsch
- Smith-Waterman
- Overlap-Alignment

In addition, it computes the traceback for these matrices and present the optimal alignment.
<br>That project handled as an homework assignment for the course: "Algorithms in Computational Biology".

<br><br>Enjoy!
